# BigBlueButton Development with DevSpaces 

## DF DevSpaces CLI Installation

You can download the setup file in [this link](https://www.devspaces.io/devspaces/download) and follow the install steps [here](https://support.devspaces.io/article/22-devspaces-client-installation).

* To download the DevSpaces CLI, you need to log in using your GitHub account.

## DF DevSpaces CLI Usage

After installation, you can use DevSpaces CLI by running `devspaces` command in the command line. It will show all actions that you can do with DevSpaces.

### Start a new DevSpace for BigBlueButton

Please, follow these steps to create a new DevSpace and build the BigBlueButton project inside it:

1. Move to `devspaces` folder. This folder contains all resources that are needed to create the DevSpace.

        cd devspaces

1. Create the DevSpace by running the following command. A new window will be shown with the build status.

        devspaces create
    
    * The notification system will shown a message when the build is finished. Then the validation process starts (it takes at least 2 minutes).

1. When the validation process is finished, you can start the the DevSpace by running the following command. 

        devspaces start BigBlueButton

    * The notification system will inform when the start is finished.

1. You can enter the created DevSpace by running the following command. 

        devspaces exec BigBlueButton

### Build and Run BigBlueButton

1. First, you need the source code inside the container. There are two approaches to get that: clone the repository inside the container (a) or bind the local repository with the container (b). 

    a. To clone the repository inside the container you can run the following command:

                git clone https://github.com/trilogy-group/bigbluebutton.git

    * If you want to clone the repository inside the `/data` folder you will need to firt clean it (**CAUTION: if it is bonded, the files in local environment will be deleted too**):

                cd /data
                rm -rf .*
                rm -rf *
                git clone https://github.com/trilogy-group/bigbluebutton.git .

    b. To bind a folder to the created and started DevSpace, it is needed to follow the steps below:

    * Make sure that the DevSpace is `Running` using the `devspaces ls` command.
    * With a running DevSpace, move to the root folder of the repository in the local machine.
    * Run the below command to bind the current folder:

                devspaces bind BigBlueButton

    * Wait to get all files synced. When you get the sync up to date, everything that is changed, deleted or created inside the local folder or in the `/data` folder inside the container will be synced. The sync is bidirectional. 
    * **Note:** If you want to stop the bind, just move to the bonded folder and run the command:

                devspaces unbind BigBlueButton

1. Before build the project, we need to run the command below to configure the environment:

        /opt/dev_setup.sh

1. BigBlueButton has many subprojects. The details on how to build each module are described in [DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/trilogy-group/bigbluebutton/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md). As an example, we will show how to build the `bigbluebutton-client` subproject. Thus, go to the `bigbluebutton-client` folder and, first, build the locales:

        cd /data/bigbluebutton-client
        ant locales

1. Next, run the following command to build the client:

        ant

1. This will create a build of the BigBlueButton client in the `/data/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-client/client` directory.

* **Important Note:** BigBlueButton has hardcoded configuration to redirect the user between services. The same configuration is used inside the backend and the frontend code. So, because a DevSpace can't access itself externally (using the given domain name and bonded ports), it is not possible to change that configuration to get it working in frontend (the exposed name and ports) and in the backend (localhost) at the same time. Thus, it is not possible to run BigBlueButton, without changing code, inside a DevSpace.
